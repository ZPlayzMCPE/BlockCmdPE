## Features it has:

* Edit which commands get blocked in config.

* Allow certain people, or groups (If using PurePerms or any other permissions plugin) to be able to use those blocked commands.

* No longer bypasses force OP if blocked /op

* A permission to bypass those blocked commands.

* Add any other colors to the message, for example, by default, it's RED. For example, you can change that to GREEN, but I'd rather if you didn't mess with it too much, if you don't know what you're doing.
